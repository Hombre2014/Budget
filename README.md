# Budget mobile app

>  Ruby or Rails capstone project

## Description

The Ruby on Rails capstone project is about building a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what. 

You will create a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:
- register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
- introduce new transactions associated with a category.
- see the money spent on each category.
